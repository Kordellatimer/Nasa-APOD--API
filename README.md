# Picture of the Day! Nasa APOD API
A simple website that allows the user to input a date they prefer. Then the picture of the date the user requested will be appended to the DOM for the user to see.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JQuery), NASA API

I added a couple images to the background and made sure the colors I used matched. I also changed the shape of the images to circles to make sure what the client is receiving is eye pleasing. I also used the the ajax method to get a response from the APOD API, then used the date the user input and concatenated it with the query request to retrieve the photo of that day. I replaced the image source from the DOM with the image source in the json.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use objects and dot notation. Also a better understanding of API's and how important it is to review the documentation on the API!

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
